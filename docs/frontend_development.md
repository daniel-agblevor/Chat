## 4. Development & Refinement Log

### 4.1. Initial Scaffolding & Logic

-   **HTML Structure:** The complete HTML structure and responsive styling with Tailwind CSS were implemented.
-   **Core Logic (`script.js`):** Event listeners, view-switching logic, and modal interactions were coded.
-   **API Integration Blueprint:** A helper function (`apiRequest`) and the necessary structures for API calls were created as a blueprint for backend integration.
-   **Simulated States:** The UI dynamically adjusts for simulated logged-in/logged-out states.

### 4.2. UI/UX Polish & Professionalization Pass

A comprehensive review and refinement pass was conducted to elevate the user experience. Key improvements include:

-   **Standardized Animations:** All sidebar transitions were consolidated into the main stylesheet for consistency. A subtle fade-and-scale animation was added to view transitions for a smoother feel.
-   **Unified Button System:** A complete overhaul of all buttons was performed.
    -   A global `active` state was implemented to give all buttons a satisfying "press" effect.
    -   Primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons were refined for color, contrast, and consistency across both light and dark modes.
-   **Theme Completion:** The light mode was made more cohesive by adding styles for the animated background blobs and scrollbars.
-   **Mobile Layout Fixes:** Corrected layout issues on mobile to ensure all views render correctly and content is scrollable.
-   **Password Confirmation:** Added a "Confirm Password" field to the registration modal to ensure users enter their password correctly.

### 4.3. Backend Integration

-   **API Connection:** Successfully connected the frontend to the live backend API.
-   **Authentication:** Implemented JWT-based authentication with token refresh.
-   **Live Data:** Replaced all mock data and simulated states with live data from the API.
-   **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling for API requests.

## 5. Next Steps (Pre-Backend Hand-off)

-   **End-to-End Testing:** Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure seamless integration and functionality.
