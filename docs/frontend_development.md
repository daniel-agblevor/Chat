# Frontend Development Updates

## 1. Overview

This document details the structure, components, and progress of the Starlight RAG frontend. The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) designed to provide a seamless user experience for interacting with the AI assistant.

**Date:** October 6, 2025

## 2. Tech Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For client-side logic, interactivity, and API communication.
-   **Lucide Icons:** For clean and modern iconography.

## 3. UI Components & Layout

The UI is built with a responsive, three-column layout where applicable.

### 3.1. Main Layout

-   **Left Sidebar (`#sidebar`):** Contains navigation, file upload button, and a list of user's files. It is collapsible on mobile devices.
-   **Main Content Area:** Displays the active view (Chat, Flashcards, or Quiz).
-   **Right Sidebar (`#right-sidebar`, etc.):** A context-sensitive sidebar that shows chat history, flashcard options, or quiz options depending on the active view.

### 3.2. Core Views

-   **Chat View (`#chat-view`):** The primary interface for users to interact with the RAG assistant. Includes a message display area, input form, and typing indicator.
-   **Flashcards View (`#flashcards-view`):** Allows users to review auto-generated flashcards. Features a flippable card interface and navigation controls.
-   **Quiz View (`#quiz-view`):** Presents a quiz to the user with progress tracking and feedback on answers.

### 3.3. Modals

-   **Settings Modal (`#settings-modal`):** Provides options for users to manage files, add special instructions for the AI, and view storage usage.
-   **Feedback Modal (`#feedback-modal`):** A simple interface for users to submit ratings and comments.

## 4. Progress & Tasks

### 4.1. Tasks Completed Today (October 6, 2025)

-   **HTML Scaffolding:** The complete HTML structure for the application has been created in `index.html`.
-   **Component Definition:** All major UI components (sidebars, views, modals) have been defined with appropriate IDs and classes.
-   **Styling Foundation:** Tailwind CSS has been integrated, and a modern, glass-morphism-inspired theme has been applied. The layout is responsive.
-   **View Placeholders:** Separate `<main>` containers for Chat, Flashcards, and Quiz views are in place, ready for dynamic content.

### 4.2. Pending Work

-   **JavaScript Implementation (`script.js`):**
    -   Implement event listeners for all interactive elements (buttons, forms, modals).
    -   Develop logic for switching between Chat, Flashcards, and Quiz views.
    -   Write functions to dynamically render data like file lists, chat messages, and history.
-   **API Integration:**
    -   Connect the UI to the backend API endpoints for file operations, chat, flashcard generation, and quizzes.
    -   Handle API responses, including loading states and errors.
-   **Custom Styling (`style.css`):**
    -   Add custom styles for animations (e.g., typing indicator) and other elements that are difficult to achieve with Tailwind alone.

## 5. Implementation & Integration Notes

-   The application will function as an SPA, dynamically showing and hiding views (`#chat-view`, `#flashcards-view`, `#quiz-view`) rather than navigating to different pages.
-   All API communication will be handled asynchronously using the Fetch API in `script.js`.
-   The frontend is designed to be stateless where possible, relying on the backend to manage user data and session information.
