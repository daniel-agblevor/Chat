# Frontend Development Updates

## 1. Overview

This document details the structure, components, and progress of the Starlight RAG frontend. The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) designed to provide a seamless user experience for interacting with the AI assistant.

**Date:** October 6, 2025

## 2. Tech Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For client-side logic, interactivity, and API communication.
-   **Lucide Icons:** For clean and modern iconography.

## 3. UI Components & Layout

The UI is built with a responsive, three-column layout where applicable.

### 3.1. Main Layout

-   **Left Sidebar (`#sidebar`):** Contains navigation, file upload button, and a list of user's files. It is collapsible on mobile devices.
-   **Main Content Area:** Displays the active view (Chat, Flashcards, or Quiz).
-   **Right Sidebar (`#right-sidebar`, etc.):** A context-sensitive sidebar that shows chat history, flashcard options, or quiz options depending on the active view.

### 3.2. Core Views

-   **Chat View (`#chat-view`):** The primary interface for users to interact with the RAG assistant. Includes a message display area, input form, and typing indicator.
-   **Flashcards View (`#flashcards-view`):** Allows users to review auto-generated flashcards. Features a flippable card interface and navigation controls.
-   **Quiz View (`#quiz-view`):** Presents a quiz to the user with progress tracking and feedback on answers.

### 3.3. Modals

-   **Settings Modal (`#settings-modal`):** Provides options for users to manage files and view their account details.
-   **Feedback Modal (`#feedback-modal`):** A simple interface for users to submit ratings and comments.

## 4. Progress & Tasks

### 4.1. Tasks Completed (as of October 6, 2025)

-   **HTML Scaffolding & Styling:** The complete HTML structure and responsive styling with Tailwind CSS are finished.
-   **JavaScript Implementation (`script.js`):**
    -   All event listeners for interactive elements (buttons, forms, modals) are implemented.
    -   Logic for switching between Chat, Flashcards, and Quiz views is complete and ensures only one view is active at a time.
    -   Functions to dynamically render data (file lists, chat messages, history) from the API are in place.
-   **API Integration:**
    -   The UI is fully connected to the backend API endpoints defined in `docs/api_specifications.md`.
    -   Asynchronous API calls handle data fetching, state updates, loading indicators, and error notifications.
-   **Authentication Handling:**
    -   The UI now dynamically adjusts based on user login status.
    -   Premium features like Flashcards and Quizzes are hidden for unauthenticated users.
    -   The main user button updates to "Login / Sign Up" for logged-out users.

### 4.2. Pending Work

-   **Backend Implementation:** The frontend is now complete and awaits a fully functional backend that adheres to the API specification.
-   **End-to-End Testing:** Once the backend is live, comprehensive testing will be required to ensure seamless integration.

## 5. Implementation & Integration Notes

-   The application functions as an SPA, dynamically showing and hiding views (`#chat-view`, `#flashcards-view`, `#quiz-view`).
-   All API communication is handled asynchronously via a dedicated `apiRequest` helper function in `script.js`.
-   The frontend is now stateful, managing application data in a central `state` object that is populated from API responses.
