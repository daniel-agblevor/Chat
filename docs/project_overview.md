# Project Documentation: Starlight RAG

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Starlight RAG
**Description:** A web-based AI assistant that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow users to chat with their documents. The application also provides features to auto-generate flashcards and quizzes from the document content, creating a comprehensive learning and data interaction tool.
**Date:** October 13, 2025

## 2. Core Features

-   **Modern UI/UX:** A polished, responsive interface with smooth animations, consistent component design, and full light/dark mode support.
-   **Document Upload & Management:** Users can upload, list, and delete their personal documents.
-   **AI Chat:** Engage in a conversation with an AI that has knowledge of the uploaded documents.
-   **Authenticated Learning Tools:** For logged-in users, the application offers:
    -   **Flashcard Generation:** Automatically create flashcard sets from document content.
    -   **Quiz Generation:** Automatically generate quizzes to test knowledge on the document's subject matter.
-   **User Feedback:** All users can submit feedback on their experience.

## 3. Current Status: Polished Frontend Demonstration

As of today, the project's frontend is a **feature-complete and polished demonstration**, ready for backend integration.

-   **UI/UX Complete:** The layout, all views (Chat, Flashcards, Quiz), and modals are visually complete, responsive, and interactive.
-   **Professional Polish:** The interface has undergone a full refinement pass, including standardizing all animations, overhauling the button system for all themes and states, and ensuring visual consistency.
-   **API Blueprint:** The frontend code is structured to integrate with the backend API as defined in `api_specifications.md`. API call structures are in place but are not connected to a live backend.
-   **Simulated States:** The application effectively demonstrates both logged-in and logged-out user experiences using simulated data and authentication.

## 5. Next Steps

With the frontend demonstration complete and polished, the exclusive focus is now on the backend.

1.  **Backend Development:**
    -   Implement the API endpoints as defined in the specifications.
    -   Set up a secure authentication system (e.g., JWT or OAuth).
    -   Configure the database and storage solution for user files and data.
    -   Integrate the RAG model and the logic for chat, flashcard, and quiz generation.
2.  **Integration & Deployment:**
    -   Connect the completed frontend to the live backend API.
    -   Deploy the full-stack application to a hosting environment.
